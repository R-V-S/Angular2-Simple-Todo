# Angular2 Simple Todo

This is an example of an extremely basic Angular2 app. It's based on the [Angular Quickstart Project](https://github.com/angular/quickstart), and makes the following modifications:

- The `<title>` tag in `/index.html` is changed
- The `FormsModule` is added to `/app/app.module.ts`
- All of the functionality for the app is in the root app component, in `/app/app.component.ts`.
